directory means folder:
look for : linux permission numbering
other way to assign or change permission is chmod but using bash I can't alter permissions on my own pc. but if we use cswing in vscode as default we can change permission access of our own computers

The .git directory does the following:
Remote information (to which remote server your project is connected)
● History of all local commits
● Branch information (on which branch is your current project state (HEAD)
pointing to)
● All logs of all local commits you have ever made (including revert
changes)
Where does the. git directory come from?
● In case of new projects, this directory is created when you open your new
project folder in terminal and type the command “git init”
● If it is an existing project, this directory is created when you bring a copy
of a repository into your local computer through the command “git clone”.
Git is software that runs locally. 
GitHub is a website/online host where you can remotely store your git
project/repositories
Git workflow: It is a guideline for how to use Git in a team project to ensure the team is
on the same page.
Git repository/repo: It is a virtual location on GitHub where a user can store code,
Repository is nothing but a folder where
files and other folders are saved remotely in cloud services like GitHub
Why README.md file? This file tells other people why
your project is useful, how they can get started using it
and what they can do with your project
● Creating a new branch:
o Type: git branch <branchName>
● List all of the branches in your repository:
o Type: git branch
● Delete a specified branch:
o Type: git branch -D < branchName >
● Rename the current branch to “newBrahchName”:
o Type: git branch -m < newBrahchNam >
Git commands:
git add . (add all files in the current directory to staging area)
git add <file_name> (add a specific file to staging area)
git commit -m “message” (commit the changes with a message)
git log (show the commit history)
git status (show the status of the repository)
git push 
git pull
forking, sending pull requests and merging
Forking: A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking is basically copying any public
repository from GitHub of someone to your GitHub
Why forking: Forking a repository allows you to freely make changes without affecting
the original project.
Clone: You will need to clone it and make it available in your local computer so
that you make changes
▪ Commit: Make changes and commit the changes
▪ Push: Push the changes.
